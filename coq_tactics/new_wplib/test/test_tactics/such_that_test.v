(**
    * Testcases for [such that].
    Subset of tests for [Assume],
    as they do excatly the same anyway.
*)

(** * Test 1
    Base case: only nested conjunctions in premise.
    Do not break down as deeply as possible,
    as the input list still contains conjunctions!
*)
Goal forall A B C: Prop, (A /\ B) /\ (B /\ C) -> (A /\ C).
    intros A B C.
    such that ab:(A /\ B) and bc:(B /\ C).
    assert_hyp_has_type @ab constr:(A /\ B).
    assert_hyp_has_type @bc constr:(B /\ C).
Abort.

(** * Test 2
    Base case: only nested conjunctions in premise.
    Do break some parts of the hypothesis to atomic expression,
    leave conjunction in others.
*)
Goal forall A B C: Prop, (A /\ B) /\ (B /\ C) -> (A /\ C).
    intros A B C.
    such that a:A and b:B and bc:(B /\ C).
    assert_hyp_has_type @a constr:(A).
    assert_hyp_has_type @b constr:(B).
    assert_hyp_has_type @bc constr:(B /\ C).
Abort.

Goal forall n, n = 1 -> n <> 2.
    intros n.
    such that n_is_one : (n = 1) .
Abort.

Goal forall x:nat, (x > 1) -> (x > 0).
Proof.
    Take x:nat; such that x_bigger_1 : (x > 1).

    assert_hyp_has_type @x constr:(nat).
    assert_hyp_has_type @x_bigger_1 constr:(x > 1).
Abort.

(**
    * Testcases for [Take ... such that ...].
*)

Goal forall n, n = 1 -> n <> 2.
    Pick n:nat such that n_is_one : (n = 1).
Abort.

Goal forall x:nat, (x > 1) -> (x > 0).
Proof.
    Take x:nat;
    such that x_bigger_1 : (x > 1).
