Testcases for the [Take] tactic.
Tests pass if they can be run without unhandled errors.

(** Test 0: This should work fine *)
Goal forall n : nat, n <= 2*n.
    Take n : nat.
Abort.

(** Test 1: Also this should work fine *)
Goal forall n : nat, n <= 2*n.
    Take x : nat.
Abort.

(** Test 2: This should raise an error, because the type does not match*)
Goal forall n : nat, n <= 2*n.
    assert_raises_error (fun () => Take n : bool).
Abort.

(** Test 3: This should raise an error, 
    because [Take] solves forall-quatifiers *)
Goal exists n : nat, n <= 2*n.
    assert_raises_error (fun() => Take n : nat).
Abort.

(** Test 4: Multi argument testcase *)
Goal forall n : nat, forall m : nat, n + m <= 2*n + m.
    Take n : nat, m : nat.
Abort.

(** Test 5: Two sets of multiple variables of the same type. *)
Goal forall (n m k: nat)  (b1 b2: bool), Nat.odd (n + m + k) = andb b1 b2.
    Take n, m, k : nat, b1, b2: bool.
Abort.

(** Test 6: Two sets of multiple variables of the same type,
    but with different names *)
Goal forall (n m k: nat)  (b1 b2: bool), Nat.odd (n + m + k) = andb b1 b2.
    Take a, b, c : nat, d, e: bool.
Abort.

(** Test 7: not allowed to introduce so many bools *)
Goal forall (n m k: nat)  (b1 b2: bool), Nat.odd (n + m + k) = andb b1 b2.
    assert_raises_error (fun () => Take a, b, c, d, e: bool).
Abort.

(** Test 8: look how crazy many vars we can introduce*)
Goal forall (a b c d e f g: nat) (b1 b2: bool), 
    Nat.odd (a + b + c + d + e + f + g) = andb b1 b2.
    Take a, b, c, d, e, f, g : nat, b1, b2: bool.
Abort.

(** Test 9: This should give a helpful error.
    (Note that two variables have the same name "a"!)

    Currently it raises "Internal (err:(a is already used.))"
    which seems clear enough :)
    *)
Goal forall (a b c d e f g: nat) (b1 b2: bool), 
    Nat.odd (a + b + c + d + e + f + g) = andb b1 b2.
    assert_raises_error (fun() => Take a, b, c, d, e, f, g : nat, a, h: bool).
Abort.

(** Test 10: Two sets of multiple variables of the same type.
    But in a *different order* with different names.

    This should raise an error, as the order of introducing variables is different.
*)
Goal forall (n m k: nat)  (b1 b2: bool), Nat.odd (n + m + k) = andb b1 b2.
    assert_raises_error (fun() => Take y, u: bool, a, b, c : nat).
Abort.
