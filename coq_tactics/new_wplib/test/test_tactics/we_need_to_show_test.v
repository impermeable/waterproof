(* Base case: test all syntax variants*)
Lemma one_is_one: 1 = 1.
Proof.
  We need to show (1 = 1).
  We need to show that (1 = 1).
  We need to show : (1 = 1).
  We need to show that : (1 = 1).
  To show (1 = 1).

(* Corner case: function definitions are judgementally equal
  to the function name. So they should be interchangeable. *)
Definition double := fun (x: nat) => 2*x.
Lemma with_function_definition: double 2 = 4.
Proof.
  We need to show (double 2 = 4).
  We need to show (2*2 = 4).
  trivial.

(* Error case: wrong goal supplied. *)
Lemma two_is_two: 2 = 2.
Proof.
