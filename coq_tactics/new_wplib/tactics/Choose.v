(** * choose_varible_in_exists_goal_with_renaming
    Instantiate a variable in an [exists] [goal], according to a given [constr], and also renames
    the [constr].

    Arguments:
        - [s: ident], an [ident] for naming an idefined [constr]/variable.
        - [t: constr], the requirted [constr] that needs to be instantiated.

    Does:
        - instantiates the [constr] [t] under the name [s].

    Raises Exceptions:
        - [ChooseError], if the [goal] is not an [exists] [goal].

    end.



(** * choose_variable_in_exists_no_renaming
    Instantiate a variable in an [exists] [goal], according to a given [constr], without renaming
    said [constr].

    Arguments:
        - [t: constr], the requirted [constr] that needs to be instantiated.

    Does:
        - instantiates the [constr] [t] under the same name.

    Raises Exceptions:
        - [ChooseError], if the [goal] is not an [exists] [goal].
