(** * either_case_1_or_case_2
    Split the proof by case distinction.

    Arguments:
        - [t1 : constr], the first case.
        - [t2 : constr], the second case.

    Does:
        - splits the proof by case distinction; also prints a recommendation for the user 
          to specifically write in which case he is working on.
