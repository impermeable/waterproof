Tactic [It suffices to show that ...].
Used to assert that a certain statement would be able to prove the goal.
After that, one still needs to prove this statement, but not the original goal.

(** * try_enough_expression
    Execute a function [f] (assuming it contains
    an expression that applies the [enough ... by ...] tactic).
    If it succeeds, print that [statement] is sufficient to show the goal.
    Raise an error if [f] also does.

    Arguments:
        - [f: unit -> unit], expression applying the tactic [enough ... by ...].
        - [statement: constr], statement that was 'enough' 
            evidence to proof the goal. Only used for printing purposes.
    
    Raises exceptions:
        - [AutomationFailure], in case [f] throws an error.
            This typically happens if the [enough ... by ...]-expression fails
            to prove the goal.

(** * apply_enough_with_waterprove
    Try if the [waterprove] automation would be able to solve
    the current goal, if [statement] were to hold.
    If it succeeds, the goal is removed, 
    and proving [statement] is added as a new goal.
    If it fails, an error will be raised.

    Arguments:
        - [statement: constr], statement to assume to hold
            (and to be proven later).
    
    Raises exceptions:
        - [AutomationFailure], in case [waterprove] fails to prove the goal,
            even if [statement] is given.

(** * It suffices to show that ...
    Same as the function [apply_enough_with_waterprove].

    Take [statement] as a given fact, 
    and try to prove the current goal automatically with it.
    If it succeeds, the goal is removed, 
    and proving [statement] is added as a new goal.
    If it fails, an error will be raised.

    Arguments:
        - [statement: constr], statement to assume to hold
            (and to be proven later).
    
    Raises exceptions:
        - [AutomationFailure], in case no proof is found for the goal,
            even if [statement] is given.

(** * apply_enough_with_tactic
    Take [statement] as a given fact, 
    and try to prove the current goal using the specified tactic(s) [tac].
    If it succeeds, the goal is removed, 
    and proving [statement] is added as a new goal.
    If it fails, an error will be raised.

    Arguments:
        - [statement: constr], statement to assume to hold
            (and to be proven later).
        - [tac: unit -> unit], expression containing a tactic
            that is supposed to prove the current goal 
            (usually using [statement] as a hypothesis).
            This can be a concatenation of tactics enclosed in [(] and [])]
            separated by [;]. E.g. [tac := (apply some_lemma;assumption)].
    
    Raises exceptions:
        - [AutomationFailure], in case evaluating [tac] does not prove the goal,
            even if [statement] is given.
