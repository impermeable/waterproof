(** * By ... it holds that ... : ...
    Introduce a new sublemma and try to prove it immediately,
    optionally using a given lemma.

    Arguments:
        - [id: ident], name for the new sublemma.
            If the proof succeeds, 
            it will become a hypotheses bearing [id] as name.
        - [conclusion: constr], the actual content 
            of the new sublemma to prove.
        - [proving_lemma: constr], optional reference to a lemma 
            used to prove the new sublemma (via [waterprove)]).

    Raises exception:
        - [AutomationFailure], if [waterprove] fails the prove the sublemma.
            This happens if the sublemma does not hold,
            but can also happen if it is simply too difficult for [waterprove].

(** * It holds that ... : ...
    Introduce a new sublemma and try to prove it immediately.
    Same as [By ... it holds that ... : ...],
    but without using a specified lemma.

    Arguments:
        - [id: ident], name for the new sublemma.
            If the proof succeeds, 
            it will become a hypotheses bearing [id] as name.
        - [conclusion: constr], the actual content 
            of the new sublemma to prove.
